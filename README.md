Marvel Character Cards
===========

Playing with the Marvel API: http://developer.marvel.com/

Loads up all the characters it can fetch from the API and displays them. When the user clicks on a card, it will show who this character has met (been in a event/series/story) together.

Setup
===========
Well it's just HTML and JS at the moment so you don't really need to set anything up except for providing your own API key which you can get from the developer gateway.

Look at the first two lines of the marvel_service.js file and replace the gibberish with your public and private key. Will implement a PHP wrapper of some sorts in future - if bothered.
